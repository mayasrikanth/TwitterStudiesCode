# TwitterStudiesCode


Code for an ongoing project to understand network effects 
and sentiment propogation in a social media network, with 
the ultimate aim of proposing a mechanism design solution 
to mitigate trolling using AI techniques. The current focus
of the project is the #MeToo twitter movement--all data
analyzed thus far is queried on a #MeToo-related keyword.
