# Motivation 

In this repository, you will find code for an ongoing project to understand network effects, 
sentiment propogation, and trolling in a social media network, with 
the ultimate aim of proposing an AI-driven solution for online abuse. 
The current focus of our work is the #MeToo twitter movement--all Twitter
data analyzed thus far is queried on a #MeToo-related keyword.

## Recent Work 
See https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05332 to read more about our ongoing work where we use
natural language proceessing techniques to uncover keywords in #MeToo social media 
data for troll detection. Our keyword extraction methods currently utilize GloVe (Global Vectors for 
Word Representation), a renown word embedding model proposed in 2014 by Stanford Researchers.
See the explanation of the model here: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/.
