# Motivation 

In this repository, you will find code for an ongoing project to understand network effects, 
sentiment propogation, and trolling in a social media network, with 
the ultimate aim of proposing an AI-driven solution for online abuse. 
The current focus of our work is the 2017-present #MeToo twitter movement.



## Recent Work 
See https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05332 to read more about our ongoing work where we develop
natural language processing techniques to uncover keywords in #MeToo social media 
data for troll detection. Our keyword extraction methods currently utilize GloVe (Global Vectors for 
Word Representation), a renown word embedding model proposed in 2014 by Stanford Researchers.
See the explanation of the model here: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/.


See https://polmeth2020.org/finding-social-media-trolls-dynamic-keyword-selection-methods-rapidly-evolving-online, 
our poster which shows findings from our method when applied to billions of historical MeToo tweets and to realtime 
data.
