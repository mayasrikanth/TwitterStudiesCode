@NoTimeToBeCool @POTUS The problem is that women get to decide what is a compliment or harassment, well after the fact.  If you defend #metoo you are defending a system that is too easily abused, and clearly unfair to the accused.  Also women kept quiet about this forever and enabled it. 
@realDailyWire Western culture is way overly sexualized. The disorder can be pointed back to media - in our faces - the whole #MeToo¬†¬†movement is indicative of it. Don‚Äôt objectify me, but let me objectify myself and if eye rape me you‚Äôre a sexual deviant? https://t.co/lZ3pxyPROw

@ProdigyNelson @metoohq Why would you call your app MeToo??? 
@RealSaleemJuma That's why the #metoo crap is so bad for our constitution. It absolutely removes "innocent until proven guilty". We need to stop putting celebrities up on a pedestal and treating them like they are gods, they are people who play pretend for a living.

At best, they complain publicly, at worst, you raped them by not texting them goodnight..

@solusnan1 It's not the #MeToo movement that Bannon and his target audience are scared of. It's having to compete for power and money against women as well as other men. Secure men, like secure women, know their worth and aren't threatened by this. Most welcome sharing the responsibilities.
